# Machine-Learning-Introduction
Some basic machine learning topics for learning purposes

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques. The materials cover a range of topics from basic regression to clustering and deep learning approaches.

## Contents

### Notebooks
- **Introduction_and_Regression.ipynb**: Covers basic ML concepts and regression techniques
- **Clustering_and_Probabilities.ipynb**: Explores clustering algorithms and probability-based methods
- **Comparison_of_DBSCAN_and_K_means.ipynb**: Detailed comparison between two popular clustering algorithms
- **Non_parametric_methods_and_deep_learning.ipynb**: Introduction to non-parametric approaches and neural networks

### Datasets
The `data/` directory contains several datasets used in the notebooks:
- `air_temp.csv`: Temperature data for time series analysis
- `chooseK.csv`: Dataset for K-means cluster analysis
- `FMIData.csv`: Finnish Meteorological Institute data
- `mall_customers.csv`: Customer segmentation dataset
- `Mushroom data.csv`: Mushroom classification dataset
- `youtube_comments.csv`: Text data for NLP demonstrations
